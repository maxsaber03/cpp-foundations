# cpp-foundations

This repository documents my learning and experimentation with core C++ concepts,
with an emphasis on understanding how the language behaves close to the machine.

The focus of this repository includes:
- C++ language fundamentals and syntax
- Memory concepts (stack vs heap, object lifetime, pointers, references)
- Basic object-oriented programming mechanics
- Small exploratory programs tied to coursework and self-study

This is an evolving repository intended to reflect my progress as I deepen my
understanding of C++ and systems-level programming.
